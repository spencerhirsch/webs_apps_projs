                    I'm a fourth year student at Florida Institute of Technology studying Computer Science. I am graduating
                    with my Bachelor's degree in May of this year and I'm eager to start pursuing my career as a Software 
                    Engineer. I am currently looking for work, you can find out more information about my work history <a href="resume.html"> here</a>.
                    
                    <br><br> <!-- Adding gaps to the paragraph. -->
 
                    Outside of school, I am a Key-Carrying Team Sports Lead at Dick's Sporting Goods. I have been working at the company
                    for 5 years in this coming June. In addition to this, I work at my family's bakery, Nothing Bundt Cakes,
                    doing various tasks around the store, helping out where I am needed most.

                    <br><br>

                    I have many hobbies as well, I'm currently training for a half-marathon on February 11, 2024. I'm very much
                    looking forward to participating in this event as it will be my first half-marathon of what I expect to be many. 
                    This is part of a long term goal of completing a full Iron Man with my dad. We are expecting to do that within 
                    the next few years. As a result of this goal I also cycle and I will be starting to swim following the completition of
                    the half-marathon. Alongside all of that, the one thing I am most passionate about is rock climbing.
